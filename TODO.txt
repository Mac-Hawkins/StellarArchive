Features
1. Make the explanation pop up from the bottom and only go 3/4 or so up.
2. Allow screen to flip when phone is held landscape vs vertically.
3. Allow retrieval of an image by selecting a date.
4. Add loading text when waiting for an image to load.
5. Only fetch the data once. Meaning if I swipe back to an image, I shouldn't have to re-fetch it using the API.
6. Cleanup index.tsx.

Bug:
1. There seems to be more API queries than necessary on startup. Not sure why. Need to look into.
2. Bringing up the Explanation screen might be a bit buggy still. Can't tell.
