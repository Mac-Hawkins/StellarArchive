Features
1. Make the explanation pop up from the bottom and only go 3/4 or so up.
2. Allow screen to flip when phone is held landscape vs vertically.
3. Allow retrieval of an image by selecting a date.
4. Add loading text when waiting for an image to load.
5. Only fetch the data once. Meaning if I swipe back to an image, I shouldn't have to re-fetch it using the API.

Bugs
1. Going to explanation screen and clicking the back arrow briefly causes the explanation title to align left.
2. Back arrow is on APOD screen. Don't think it should be.
3. There seems to be more API queries than necessary on startup. Not sure why. Need to look into.
